# An Analysis of School District
## Overview
Maria is the Chief Data Scientist who prepares standardized tast data for analysis, reporting and performance trends.  She is responsible for analyzing data of funding and standardized test scores.  After our original analysis was provided, the school board discovered that the orignal .csv file might have been altered. 
### Purpose
Initially, we were asked to aggregate the data and showcase trends and school performances for the School Board/Superintendent to use in setting school budgets and priorities.  Now, we have been asked to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact, then repeat our analysis and report on how these changes affected the overall analysis.  This included tables witht he following metric(s):
* Average math scores and percentages by student in each grade at each school
* Average reading scores and percentages by student in each grade at each school
* Top five (5) performing schools based on overal passing rates
* Bottom five (5) performing schools based on overal passing rates
* School performance based on budget per student
* School performance based on school size
* School performance based on school type
## Resources
Data:  .csv files:  students_complete, schools_complete, clean_students_complete, missing_grades<br/>
Software(s):  Python 3.7, Jupyter Lab 3.0.14, Pandas, NumPy
